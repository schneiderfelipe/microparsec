# petametre

petametre is a parser combinator library for Nim.
<!-- With petametre you can implement recursive‐descent text parsers for formal grammars.

petametre's features include:

- support for context‐sensitive, infinite look‐ahead grammars
- automatically generated, highly readable error messages
- Unicode support
- efficient support for very large files
- an embeddable, runtime‐configurable operator‐precedence parser component
- a simple, efficient and easily extensible API
- an implementation thoroughly optimized for performance
- comprehensive documentation
- a permissive open source license

petametre is a Nim adaptation of Parsec, the popular parser combinator library for Haskell by Daan Leijen.
While the implementations of Parsec and petametre are completely different, they share a similar top‐level API. -->
