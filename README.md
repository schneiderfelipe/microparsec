# petametre

petametre is a monadic parser combinator library for Nim.
It is a feature-rich package that tries to find a nice balance between speed, flexibility, and quality of parse errors.

<!-- petametre's features include:

- support for context‐sensitive, infinite look‐ahead grammars
- automatically generated, highly readable error messages
- Unicode support
- efficient support for very large files
- an embeddable, runtime‐configurable operator‐precedence parser component
- a simple, efficient and easily extensible API
- an implementation thoroughly optimized for performance
- comprehensive documentation
- a permissive open source license

petametre is a Nim adaptation of Parsec, the popular parser combinator library for Haskell by Daan Leijen.
While the implementations of Parsec and petametre are completely different, they share a similar top‐level API. -->
